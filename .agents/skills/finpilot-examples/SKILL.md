# finpilot Example Scripts

## When to Use

- You need to add a third-party repository or desktop swap
- You want to understand the `.example` → `.sh` activation pattern
- You are creating a new build script and want a starting point
- You need to document a new pattern for contributors

## When NOT to Use

- You are modifying existing active `.sh` scripts directly — edit them, don't activate an example
- You are adding a simple package — use `build/10-build.sh` directly, no example needed

## Core Process

1. **Find the relevant example** in `build/` directory
2. **Copy and rename** from `.example` to `.sh`
3. **Add its explicit `RUN` block** after `10-build.sh` in `Containerfile`
4. **Customize** for your specific use case
5. **Validate** with `shellcheck` and `just build`
6. **Commit** (via PR to `main`)

## The Activation Pattern

All example scripts in `build/` follow the pattern:

1. **Inactive**: Named `NN-descriptive-name.sh.example`
2. **Activate the file**: Rename to `NN-descriptive-name.sh`
3. **Activate execution**: Add an explicit `RUN` block after `10-build.sh` in `Containerfile`

The template does not automatically discover numbered scripts. See `build/README.md` for the standard mounted `RUN` block; replace its script path with the activated example.

## Existing Example Scripts

### `build/40-nvidia.sh.example`

**What it does:**

- Pulls pre-built NVIDIA akmods from `ghcr.io/ublue-os/akmods-nvidia-open`
- Installs NVIDIA driver (open kernel modules, CUDA, libnvidia-container)
- Configures CDI (Container Device Interface) GPU passthrough for Podman
- Writes bootc kernel args: nouveau blacklist + `nvidia-drm.modeset=1`
- Enables Mutter `kms-modifiers` for Wayland support on NVIDIA

**How to activate:**

```bash
mv build/40-nvidia.sh.example build/40-nvidia.sh
# Add the standard RUN block for /ctx/build/40-nvidia.sh after 10-build.sh.
# See build/README.md.
just build
```

All NVIDIA logic is self-contained in the script. It provisions NVIDIA support directly into the base image when both the script is renamed to `.sh` and its Containerfile `RUN` block is added. Deactivate by removing that `RUN` block and renaming the file back to `.example`.

**Expected validation:**

- `pr-validation.yml` → shellcheck
- `build-image.yml` → full build test
- **Must test on actual NVIDIA hardware** — Wayland/modeset issues are not caught in CI

---

### `build/20-onepassword.sh.example`

**What it does:**

- Adds the 1Password repository
- Installs `1password`
- Removes the repo file after install (isolated install pattern)

**How to activate:**

```bash
cp build/20-onepassword.sh.example build/20-onepassword.sh
# Add the standard RUN block for /ctx/build/20-onepassword.sh after 10-build.sh.
# See build/README.md, then customize this script if needed.
```

**Expected validation:**

- `pr-validation.yml` → shellcheck
- `build-image.yml` → full build test

---

### `build/30-cosmic-desktop.sh.example`

**What it does:**

- Removes the GNOME desktop environment
- Installs the COSMIC desktop environment from COPR
- Sets the default graphical target

**How to activate:**

```bash
cp build/30-cosmic-desktop.sh.example build/30-cosmic-desktop.sh
# Add the standard RUN block for /ctx/build/30-cosmic-desktop.sh after 10-build.sh.
# See build/README.md, then customize this script if needed.
```

**Expected validation:**

- `pr-validation.yml` → shellcheck
- `build-image.yml` → full build test (significant change, test thoroughly)

---

## Creating New Example Scripts

When adding a new pattern that others might reuse, create an `.example` file:

1. **Name it** with the correct prefix: `20-` for third-party repos, `30-` for desktop swaps
2. **Include comments** explaining what it does and how to customize
3. **Follow conventions**: `set -euo pipefail`, `dnf5`, `copr_install_isolated` for COPRs
4. **Add the new example to this skill** so agents discover it

### Template for New Examples

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Description: [What this script does]
# Activate by: rename this file to build/NN-name.sh, then add its explicit
# RUN block after 10-build.sh in Containerfile (see build/README.md).
# Customize: [What to change]

# Example: Add a third-party repository
# dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://example.com/repo.repo
# dnf5 install -y package-name
# rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/example.repo  # Clean up repo file
```

## Validation by Example Type

| Example                      | Shellcheck | Build Test | Additional Validation                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Third-party repo (`20-*.sh`) | Yes        | Yes        | Verify repo URL accessible              |
| Desktop swap (`30-*.sh`)     | Yes        | Yes        | Test in VM (`just run-vm-qcow2`)        |
| COPR install (`20-*.sh`)     | Yes        | Yes        | Verify COPR exists and packages install |
| NVIDIA GPU (`40-nvidia.sh`)  | Yes        | Yes        | Test on NVIDIA hardware; verify `nvidia-smi` after boot |

## Link to Package Decision Tree

For deciding whether to use an example script or add directly to `build/10-build.sh`, use `finpilot-packages`.

**Quick guide:**

- Simple system packages → `build/10-build.sh`
- Third-party repo or complex install → `build/20-*.sh` (activate an example or create new)
- Desktop environment swap → `build/30-*.sh` (activate an example or create new)

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization                                              | Reality                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'll just add my script directly — no need for an example." | If the pattern is reusable, an example helps future contributors. If it's one-off, add to `10-build.sh`. |
| "I'll leave it as `.example` and never rename it."           | `.example` files are inactive. Rename one to `.sh` and add its explicit Containerfile `RUN` block.       |
| "I renamed the example, so it will run."                      | The template runs only scripts explicitly named in Containerfile. Add the matching `RUN` block.           |

## Red Flags

- `.example` file modified but not renamed to `.sh`
- Renamed `.sh` file without a matching Containerfile `RUN` block
- New `.sh` file without `set -euo pipefail`
- Script using `dnf` or `yum` instead of `dnf5`
- COPR repo not disabled after install
- Third-party repo file not removed after install
- Missing shellcheck validation before committing

## Verification

- [ ] Did you rename the `.example` file to `.sh`?
- [ ] Did you add its `RUN` block after `10-build.sh` in Containerfile?
- [ ] Did you run `shellcheck` on the new `.sh` file?
- [ ] Did the build succeed with `just build`?
- [ ] For desktop swaps: did you test in a VM (`just run-vm-qcow2`)?
- [ ] For desktop swaps: did you verify the new session works at the login screen?
- [ ] Did you document the new pattern in `AGENTS.md` or this skill?
